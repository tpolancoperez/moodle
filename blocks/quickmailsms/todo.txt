Some things to do:

   1. Replace the HTML editor with a standard text area.  I tried to do this by editing the formslib call, but there was some other function expecting input and I couldn't get it to work properly.  My workaround was to use the php function 'strip_tags' to remove any html from the form.  Ideas would be greatly appreciated.
   2. Delete all references to code involving attachments, signatures and alternate emails.  As is, they are removed from the forms, but I think leaving the functionality in the code is not a good idea.  Again, ideas would be greatly appreciated.
   3. Possibly have the 'install.xml' file automatically create the proper entries in mdl_user_info_field and mdl_user_info_data

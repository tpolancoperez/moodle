PURPOSE
-----------
The attendance module and block are designed to allow instructors of a course keep an attendance log of the students in their courses. The instructor will setup the frequency of his classes (# of days per week & length of course) and the attendance is ready for use. To take attendance, the instructor clicks on the "Update Attendance" button and is presented with a list of all the students in that course, along with 4 options: Present, Absent, Late & Excused, with a Remarks textbox. Instructors can download the attendance for their course in Excel format or text format.
Only the instructor can update the attendance data. However, a student gets to see his attendance record.

----------------
INSTALLATION
----------------
The attendance follows standard installation procedures.
Place the "attforblock" directory in your mod directory.
Then visit the Admin page in Moodle to activate it.
